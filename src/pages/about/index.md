### Welcome to Security Proz Hawaii! We are the newest up and coming security alarm company, but we are not new to this business. 

### Our family has served Hawaii for over 50 years. My name is Jack Beaumont and I started out at my grandfathers company Sentinel Silent Alarm with a sister guard and patrol company Called Honolulu Merchant Patrol. He was Hawaii’s very first alarm company with its own UL certified central station. 

### I worked in the warehouse pulling parts for future jobs, inventory control, and worked my way up to eventually installing and servicing. Sentinel was known for their excellent customer service and rapid response for repairs when needed. These are the instilled values that will continue through Security Proz Hawaii. Don’t be a victim go with a pro!
